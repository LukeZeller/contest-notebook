Euler's characteristic for planar graphs/polyhedra: V + F = E + 2 
  where V = |Vertices|, F = |Faces| (including exterior face), E = |Edges|
  
 
 Pick's Theorem for integer coordinate simple polygons: A = i + b / 2 + 1
  where A = area of polygon, i = # of strictly interior points, b = # of points on boundary of polygon
