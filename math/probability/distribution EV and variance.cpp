Uniform Distribution(A, B) : continuous distribution of uniformly random value between A and B
EV: (A + B) / 2
Variance: (b - a) ^ 2 / 12

Binomial Distribution(n, p): discrete distribution of # of successes in sequence of n independent experiments
                             p = probability of success
EV: np
Variance: np(1 - p)

Bernoulli Distribution(p): discrete distribution of # of successes given just 1 trial [same as binomial(1, p)]
EV: p
Variance: p(1 - p)

Geometric Distribution(n, p): discrete distribution of # of failures before first success, on set {0, 1, ...}
EV: (1 - p) / p
Variance: (1 - p) / p^2

Poisson Distribution(lambda): discrete distribution of # of events in fixed interval of time 
                              given average rate of events
EV: lambda
Variance: lambda
